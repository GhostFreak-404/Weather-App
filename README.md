# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project is to demonstrate my ability to use nodeJS with external api to get temp with zip codes
You should only use zip codes in the usa to get the weather temp in Â°F

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
